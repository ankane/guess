# Guess

*Statistically* determine a person's gender based on his / her name.

```ruby
Guess.gender("Don Draper")
# => {:gender => "male", :confidence => 0.9965635738831615}
Guess.gender("Betty Draper")
# => {:gender => "female", :confidence => 0.9992498124531133}
Guess.gender("Mad Men")
# => {:gender => "unknown", :confidence => nil}
```

Statistical data obtained from the [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/names_files.html), so it works best with American names.

You can call `Guess.gendered_form_of` to get a "gendered" form of some common words.

```ruby
Guess.gendered_form_of(:they, "Don Draper")
# => "he"
Guess.gendered_form_of(:their, "Betty Draper")
# => "her"
Guess.gendered_form_of(:theirs, "Mad Men")
# => "theirs"
```
